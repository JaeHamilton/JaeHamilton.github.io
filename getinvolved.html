                <p>
                    <em>There is so much more that goes into surviving abuse than experiencing the violent relationship itself.</em>
                </p>
                <p>Many survivors face additional barriers to safety when they are without the resources to get their basic needs met.<br> This includes, but is not limited to, access to food and personal hygiene products.<br> Beyond fleeing unsafe situations, our program participants often encounter ongoing, unmet needs for transportation.<br> Survivors attending various appointments with outside organizations, social service agencies, court dates and therapy sessions, for example,<br> can become overwhelmed by their lack of viable transportation. <br>All of these issues are exacerbated by the high cost of living and general effects of gentrification in the Bay Area.
                </p>

                <p>These items can help minimize some of these barriers<br> and support survivors of domestic violence with the long-term change they strive to achieve:</p>

                <p>

                    <em><Strong>Clipper cards, loaded increments of $10.00</Strong></em>

                </p>

                <ul>Why we need it:</ul>
                <li> they help us relocate participants who need<br> to leave the city due to emergencies or relocation</li>
                <li>they help our participants get around the city<br> (and the Bay Area in general) as they attend appointments, court dates, and/or work</li>
                <p>VISA/Mastercard/American Express Gift cards</p>

                <ul>Why we need it:</ul>

                <li>these cards allow us to be adaptive as we support our participants</li>
                <li>these cards can be used to purchase participant prescriptions,<br> filing fees for court, document reproduction, therapy services,<br> participant stipends and training supplies</li>
                <p>Gift cards for Walgreens, Safeway, Whole Foods, TJ Maxx, Macy’s, Ross, local restaurants, etc.</p>

                <p> Prepaid Mobile Phones and Additional Purchased Minutes</p>

                <p>Monetary Donations, in any amount</p>

                <ul>Why we need them:</ul>
                <li>a portion of our budget must be unrestricted so we can respond to unique, one-time, unplanned and emerging participant need</li>
                <li>83% of every dollar donated goes back to our programming, and has supported all of our services, materials for support groups, training presentations, and the items listed above</li>
                <p>Diapers</p>

                <p>Donation drives:</p>

                <p>Due to a lack of need and of storage, we don’t currently accept:</p>
