                <h2>24-Hour Support Line</h2>
                <p>The W.O.M.A.N., Inc. 24-hour support line offers support<br> via peer counseling, safety planning, and referrals for needed resources.<br> Very often our support line is used as a safe space for survivors to openly share details of their lives including the abuse they survive.<br> As peer counselors, our role is to support them.<br> Many times a survivor just needs someone to listen without judging, to help them better understand their experience, and to validate their feelings and choices.</p>

                <p>On our support line, we also connect with family and friends of survivors.<br> Seeing someone you love be harmed is difficult and often times,<br>a survivor’s loved ones don’t know what to do or how to best support the survivor in their life. <br>It is also common for people who love a survivor to experience a great deal of emotional distress.<br> We are here for you as well as the survivor you love.</p>

                <p>You can call us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at:
                    <stong>(877) 384-3578</stong>
                </p>

                <p>The support line can also serve as a gateway to access support services offered at W.O.M.A.N., Inc., such as our drop-in support, therapy, peer support groups, and Latinx Program.</p>

                <p> Led by trained facilitators, our peer support groups offer a safe space for survivors of domestic violence to share their experience with and gain insight from each other.<br> In these groups, survivors are invited to explore their feelings, receive and offer support, and gain important tools needed to heal from the effects of violent relationships.<br> Our groups include practical information about the dynamics of abuse. We often use art and other expressive modalities in our groups.</p>
